# Personal Config-Files

I like to setup my computers mostly the same, running Ubuntu Linux with i3 wm. But I am simply bored with setting them up, hence the use of ansible.

There are also some helper scripts contained here to ensure that 

- shortcut-script.py - is a small watchdog script for my macro keyboard so I can have some tasks on a special keyboard itself.
- scan2paperless - modified paperless scan script so I do not have to perform the bothersome tasks of scanning, then saving, then opening a browser, then uploading to paperless, etc.
- post2paperless - dependency for scan2paperless, actual upload logic.
